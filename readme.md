# Important points to note!

1. This project is created under TSG website hackathon by Team Incognito.
2. Since we are a team of two, and my team mate being engaged in a different project, was unable to contribute much to the project.
3. Hence, I tried my best to complete the website alone but this may lead to unfulfilling of some of the expectations from the problem statement due to time constraint.
4. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.

# Important points to remember!

1. Please use your mobile data internet to run the website, as KGP's LAN/WiFi is denied access to mongo db's servers.
2. The website doesn't use any templates and has been coded from scratch.
3. Due to time constraint, the website couldn't be made responsive.
4. Website experience is best when populated with large chunk of data.
